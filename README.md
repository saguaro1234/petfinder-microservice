# Petfinder Microservice

**For:** Jennifer Putsche's Pet Program  
**Purpose:**  
This microservice receives a U.S. ZIP code in JSON format and returns data for up to **10 pet adoption facilities** located within a **50-mile radius** of the provided ZIP code.

---

## Required Python Libraries

- `json`
- `socket`

---

## Microservice Connection Configuration

```python
HOST = '127.0.0.1'
PORT = 5555
````

---

## Starting a Connection (Client Side)

To connect to the microservice from your main program:

```python
import socket

with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as s:
    s.connect((HOST, PORT))
```

---

## Sending Data to the Microservice

Send a ZIP code to the server using a JSON object. The ZIP code **must be sent in JSON format**:

```python
import json

zipcode_data = {"zipcode": "12345"}
json_string = json.dumps(zipcode_data)
s.sendall(json_string.encode('utf-8'))
```

---

## Receiving Data from the Microservice

Once the ZIP code is processed, the server responds with JSON data:

```python
response_data = s.recv(4096).decode('utf-8')
response_json = json.loads(response_data)
```

---

## Error Handling

If the microservice receives an **invalid or unrecognized ZIP code**, it will return:

```python
False
```

---

## Example Response Structure (Success)

```json
{
  "Happy Paws Shelter": {
    "name": "Happy Paws Shelter",
    "email": "contact@happypaws.org",
    "phone": "555-1234",
    "address": {
      "city": "Springfield",
      "state": "IL"
    }
  },
  "Pet Haven Rescue": {
    "name": "Pet Haven Rescue",
    "email": "info@pethaven.com",
    "phone": "555-5678",
    "address": {
      "city": "Lincoln",
      "state": "IL"
    }
  }
}
```

## Notes

* This microservice listens on port `5555` at localhost (`127.0.0.1`).
* Ensure the server is running before attempting to connect from the client.
* If you plan to scale or deploy, consider handling multiple requests with threading or asynchronous I/O.
